Databases are managed using a software called <em>**Database Management System** (DBMS)</em>, which allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Databases are the backbone of modern applications, supporting businesses, organizations, and systems across industries. Most of the applications that we use everyday (like WhatsApp, Gmail, Social Media Websites, etc.) have a database that stores user, transaction and all other required information."

        "Different types of databases exist to meet diverse use-case needs, driven by variations in data structure, access patterns, scalability, and consistency requirements. Relational databases are ideal for structured data with predefined schemas, common in traditional business applications. The rise of big data and real-time analytics exposed limitations of relational databases, leading to NoSQL databases, which offer flexibility and scalability for unstructured or semi-structured data. More recently, vector databases have emerged to support machine learning applications by efficiently handling high-dimensional vector data used in similarity searches.\n",

        "- **Relational Databases -** Store data in **structured tables** with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server. (RDBMS)\n",

        "    - **Graph Databases -** Focus on the relationships between data objects. They use **nodes** to represent data entities and **edges** to define relationships between them, enabling efficient traversal and retrieval of complex interconnected data. They excels at handling complex relationships, making them ideal for use cases such as social networks, recommendation systems, and network analysis. Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Ultipa.\n",
        "    - **Vector Databases -** Designed to store, index, and manage vector **embeddings**, which are high-dimensional data representations often used in machine learning models. These db enables fast similarity search, allowing efficient identification of vectors that are \"close\" to a given query vector using distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. This makes them suitable for tasks as image recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. They utilize indexing structures that optimize the retrieval of similar vectors based on distance metrics. Examples: Faiss, Milvus, Qdrant, chroma."

In the context of databases, a **transaction** is any operation that the database considers a single unit of work. A transaction must complete fully for the database to remain consistent. For example, when you transfer money from one bank account to another, the money must leave your account and must be added to the third-party account. You cannot call the transaction complete without both steps occurring. \n",

In contrast, **BASE** databases prioritize availability over consistency. Instead of failing the transaction, users can access inconsistent data temporarily. Data consistency is achieved, but not immediately. Examples of **ACID** databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Neo4j and MongoDB, wherease of **BASE** Elasticsearch.\n"
